The film received positive reviews from audiences and critics, who praised Raimi's direction and tone, the faithfulness and fidelity to the Spider-Man mythos, the action sequences, visual effects, Danny Elfman's musical score, and the performances of the cast (particularly that of Maguire, Dafoe, and J. K. Simmons). The film became a financial success: it was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend, and became the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of over $821.7 million worldwide, it was the third highest-grossing film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film and the sixth highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. Spider-Man is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the summer blockbuster.[7][8][9] Its success led to Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3 in 2004 and 2007, respectively.",
